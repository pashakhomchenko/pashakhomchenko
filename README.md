### Hey, I'm Pasha 👋

I am a CS major at the University of Michigan. My main expertise is in Full-Stack Development (React, Next.js, Flask), but I want to explore more areas in-depth: AI/ML, Backend, AR/VR, Quant. I've been a Software Engineering Intern at an early-stage startup accelerator where I worked on a bunch of different projects. I am always open to meeting people working on interesting products and projects. Please reach out at any time if you'd like to build something cool together!

## About 📝
